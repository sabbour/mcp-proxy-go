- **Model Context Protocol Team** - Protocol specification and reference implementations

## Go Port

- Generated with AI assistance using GitHub Copilot
- Architecture and design patterns adapted from the original TypeScript codebase
- Session management, authentication, and transport layers reimplemented in Go

## Attribution

The core concepts, API design, request handling patterns, and overall architecture
are derived from the original TypeScript implementation by punkpeye. This Go port
adapts these patterns while maintaining compatibility with the MCP specification.
